# Future Improvements & Feature Roadmap

This document outlines potential new features and enhancements to improve the Trimology application for clients, staff, and administrators. It includes both conventional and AI-powered ideas.

## **Part 1: AI-Powered Features**

Leverage artificial intelligence to create a smarter, more personalized experience.

### **1. AI-Powered Scheduling Assistant**
*   **Description:** Instead of just showing available slots, an AI model could suggest the *optimal* appointment time. It would analyze staff availability, service durations, and even historical booking data to minimize gaps in a stylist's schedule, maximizing their efficiency.
*   **Benefit:** Increased revenue per stylist by reducing idle time. A more dynamic and intelligent booking experience for the client.

### **2. Personalized Service & Retail Recommendations**
*   **Description:** Analyze a client's booking history and suggest add-on services or retail products. For example, if a client frequently books a "Modern Fade," the system could suggest a "Beard Trim" as a complementary service or recommend a specific hair product used by their preferred stylist.
*   **Benefit:** Increases the average value of each client visit. Provides a personalized touch that encourages client loyalty.

### **3. Review Analysis & Summarization**
*   **Description:** Use a language model to analyze customer feedback from online reviews or post-appointment surveys. The AI would identify recurring themes, sentiment (positive/negative), and specific feedback related to staff or services. Admins would get a high-level summary (e.g., "Clients love the new coffee machine," "Several reviews mention that Alice gives great consultations").
*   **Benefit:** Saves admin time and provides actionable insights to improve service quality and address issues proactively.

### **4. Automated, Personalized Reminders & Follow-ups**
*   **Description:** Go beyond generic SMS reminders. Use AI to generate friendly, natural-sounding reminder messages. It could also automatically send a personalized follow-up message a day after the appointment asking for a review or feedback.
*   **Benefit:** Reduces no-shows and improves customer engagement, leading to more reviews and valuable feedback.

### **5. Dynamic Pricing Suggestions (Admin Tool)**
*   **Description:** An AI tool for admins that analyzes booking data to identify periods of high and low demand. It could suggest small, dynamic price adjustments—like a slight discount for a Tuesday morning haircut or a minor premium for a peak Saturday slot—to optimize booking distribution and maximize revenue.
*   **Benefit:** Helps the business maximize its earning potential without requiring manual analysis.

## **Part 2: Client Experience Enhancements**

Features focused on making the booking and visit process smoother for the customer.

### **1. Client Accounts & Profiles**
*   **Description:** Allow clients to create an optional account with a password. This would save their booking history, contact details, and preferred staff/service, making re-booking a one-click process.
*   **Benefit:** Dramatically improves the experience for repeat customers and strengthens their relationship with the salon.

### **2. Online Cancellation & Rescheduling**
*   **Description:** Give clients the ability to cancel or request to reschedule their own appointments via the "My Visits" page (up to a certain time, e.g., 24 hours before).
*   **Benefit:** Reduces administrative overhead from phone calls and messages. Provides convenience and flexibility for clients.

### **3. Multi-Service Booking**
*   **Description:** Allow clients to select multiple services in a single booking session (e.g., a "Classic Haircut" and a "Beard Trim"). The system would intelligently find a time slot that accommodates the total duration.
*   **Benefit:** Increases the average booking value and meets a common customer need.

### **4"Waitlist" Feature**
*   **Description:** If a desired time slot or staff member is fully booked, allow clients to join a waitlist. They would be automatically notified if a spot opens up due to a cancellation.
*   **Benefit:** Recovers potentially lost bookings and provides a valuable service for clients with flexible schedules.

## **Part 3: Admin & Staff Tool Enhancements**

Features designed to make management and daily operations easier.

### **1. Advanced Reporting & Analytics**
*   **Description:** A dedicated reporting section in the admin dashboard. Visualize key metrics like revenue per service, staff member performance (e.g., number of bookings, client retention), client visit frequency, and peak booking times.
*   **Benefit:** Provides data-driven insights to make informed business decisions about staffing, service offerings, and marketing.

### **2. Staff Rota & Time-Off Management**
*   **Description:** Allow admins to manage staff schedules directly in the app. Staff members could also use the app to request time off, which would automatically block out their availability for booking.
*   s**Benefit:** Centralizes and simplifies scheduling, reducing errors and saving time.

### **3. Inventory Management for Retail Products**
*   **Description:** A simple system for tracking retail product stock levels. Admins can add products, update quantities, and get alerts when stock is low.
*   **Benefit:** Helps manage a key revenue stream and ensures popular products are always available.

### **4. Client Notes**
*   **Description:** Allow staff to add private notes to a client's profile (e.g., "Prefers a #2 guard on the sides," "Allergic to a certain product," "Loves to talk about football"). These notes would be visible to staff before the next appointment.
*   **Benefit:** Enables a highly personalized service that makes clients feel valued and understood, boosting retention.
